# Story
# ejiniÊàòÁ•û has recently quit his programming job and is now opting in for a career change. He has decided to settle in the baking industry and is now a worker of a cake franchise designated for wedding celebrations. He has come up with a creative wedding cake model and a unique box that can modify the cake in a certain way that can blow away all the attendees!!! (How cool is that~ üòè)

# Task
# Given the cake model, your job is to help ejiniÊàòÁ•û write a program that can instantly display the final visualization of the cake model after the unique box has been unfolded.

# Initial cake model below:

#     /|\
#    \/ \/
#   \ | | \
#   /\/\/\/
#  /       \
# /|||||||||\
# The final visualization:

#     /|\
#    \ | /
#   \  |  \
#   /  |  /
#  /   |   \
# /    |    \
# More examples:

#       \         \
#     // |||||||||\\/
#    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
#    / /| \ /\|\ /| |/
# /||||||||\/| /\||||||\\
# becomes

#       \    |    \
#     /      |      /
#    \       |       \
#    /       |       /
# /          |          \
#    /         \
#    /         \ 
#    /         \
#    /         \
#    /         \
#    /         \ 
# becomes

#    /    |    \
#    /    |    \ 
#    /    |    \
#    /    |    \
#    /    |    \
#    /    |    \ 
# Notes

# Each cake model will have at least 1 layer (row), separated by a newline character (\n)
# Each layer will only consist of odd number of filling space
# The lower layer will have equal or more filling space than the upper ones
# Each layer will always start and end with / or \ fillings
# Starting and ending position of each layer will not overlap
# Inner fillings of the cake may be /, \ or |
# Some part of the cake do not have fillings (due to the semi-functional cake creation model...)
# Trailing and leading spaces for the visualization above will not be included in the cake model's input and final output.
# \\ for visualization above only is considered as 2 fillings rather than 1.
# Output should be the same as the given input except with all fillings of each layer centralized whilst leaving a starting and ending filling to prevent it from overflow ^^. (Refer to examples above)
