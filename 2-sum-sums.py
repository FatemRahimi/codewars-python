# 2-Sum is a common task to find the pair of integers in the array such that their sum equals to the target.

# array = [1,2,3,4,5]
# target = 7

# Pair is (2, 5)
# Task
# There is an array of unique integers.

# The task is to find the sum of all targets in the specific range [from, to), which has a pair in the array, such that sum of the pair equals to the target.

# Example
# Array = [2, 4, 6, 10], target range is [6, 10)

# target = 6  =>  (2, 4)
# target = 7  =>  no pair
# target = 8  =>  (2, 6)
# target = 9  =>  no pair

# So the result is: 6 + 8 = 14
# Notes
# Both elements of the pair must be unique
# Each target will be counted once, even though there may exist multiple pairs which add up to it
# Your solution will be tested for performance
