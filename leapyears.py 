In this kata you should simply determine, whether a given year is a leap year or not. In case you don't know the rules, here they are:

Years divisible by 4 are leap years,
but years divisible by 100 are not leap years,
but years divisible by 400 are leap years.
Tested years are in range 1600 ≤ year ≤ 4000.


function isLeapYear(year) {
  if(0 == year%400) return true;
  if(0 == year%100) return false;
  if(0 == year%4) return true;
  return false;
}
