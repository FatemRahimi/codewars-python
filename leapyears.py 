In this kata you should simply determine, whether a given year is a leap year or not. In case you don't know the rules, here they are:

Years divisible by 4 are leap years,
but years divisible by 100 are not leap years,
but years divisible by 400 are leap years.
Tested years are in range 1600 ≤ year ≤ 4000.


function isLeapYear(year) {
  if(0 == year%400) return true;
  if(0 == year%100) return false;
  if(0 == year%4) return true;
  return false;
}

const { assert } = require('chai');

describe("Example tests", () => {
  
  it("Year 2020 is a leap year", () => {
      assert.strictEqual(isLeapYear(2020), true, "Incorrect answer for year = 2020");
  });

  it("Year 2000 is a leap year", () => {
      assert.strictEqual(isLeapYear(2000), true, "Incorrect answer for year = 2000");
  });

  it("Year 2015 is not a leap year", () => {
      assert.strictEqual(isLeapYear(2015), false, "Incorrect answer for year = 2015");
  });

  it("Year 2100 is not a leap year", () => {
      assert.strictEqual(isLeapYear(2100), false, "Incorrect answer for year = 2100");
  });
});
